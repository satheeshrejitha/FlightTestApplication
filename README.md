# FlightTestApplication
Sample Flight Class with dependency Injection

Invoke the FlightBuilder.GetFlights method to get some test flights and filter out those that:
 
1. Depart before the current date/time
2. Have any segment with an arrival date before the departure date
3. Spend more than 2 hours on the ground â€“ i.e. those with a total combined gap of over two hours between the arrival date of one segment and the departure date of the next

It is important to show how you would go about structuring a solution to the problem. Imagine there are lots of filter rules and that we might want to apply different sets of rules in different circumstances at run time.
